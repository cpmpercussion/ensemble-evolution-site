		<p>Our days are now consistently jam-packed with work, practice, and projects! We are working hard to prepare for some recordings on Thursday with Anders Åstrand and Evaristo Aguilar! We’ll be laying down 3 pieces that we’ve each written for the trio, as well as some improvs (of course!)

<p>Individually we’re all working on separate projects as well. Jake and Maria are doing some duo work, and just launched a Kickstarter Funding Project to commission 4 new works for percussion duo! Check it out here: <a href="http://kck.st/fGYnCK">Kickstarter</a>!! Charles is working on a trendy interactive media project that involes iPhones and iPads. We’ll all come together again at the beginning of May for a tour of southern Sweden to share everything we’re doing up here. Exciting times!</p>

<p>The temperature today was -26°C…but we’re not letting that get us down!</p>
