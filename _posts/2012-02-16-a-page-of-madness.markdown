Next week we will be hosting two fanstastic guest artists here in Piteå! Bill and Ruth Cahn will spend 6 days in Norrland, performing with us and working with the students at the University. Bill will give _Creative Music Making_ sessions to a select group of Masters students, while Ruth will coach the percussion students.

For us, the highlight of the visit will be performing Bill's music to the silent film "A Page of Madness" by Teinosuke Kinugasa from 1926! Bill has performed the work many times with NEXUS, and it will be an honor for us to perform it in their shadows!

_About the film: _

This milestone film was thought to be lost to history and was only recently rediscovered. Acted by an avant-garde theater group, “A Page of Madness” stands as one of the most challenging Japanese movies ever produced. Directed by one-time kabuki actor,Teinosuke Kinugasa, the hour-long drama employs a combination of expressionist distortions,stylized images, and pioneering devices such as flashbacks, quick cuts, and image layering, all of which leads the audience visually back and forth between ‘irrational’ and sane worlds.
