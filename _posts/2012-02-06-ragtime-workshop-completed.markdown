Our Ragtime Xylophone Workshop in Piteå is finished (for now)! With the help of our wonderful visiting artist, Christina Hopgood, we put on a concert of new and recent arrangements of ragtime and classic movie music at the School of Music in Piteå as well as a concert featuring all of the percussion students at LTU and Framnäs folkhögskolan playing ragtime xylophone solos with marimba band (videos below!).

We also played at Krokodil Café in Piteå and had an impromtu concert at Gallerian (tack Denis!).

-25°C? Time to move marimbas.
