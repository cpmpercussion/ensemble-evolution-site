We are busy editting/mixing our ensemble album that will feature 6 new works that were commissioned by and dedicated to the Treehotel in Harads, Sweden! We premiered the new works under/next to/inside of each tree houselast June (see Nattmusik tour post below, or check out Maria's website for photos) Starting today (Monday, August 6), we'll release a teaser video fo each of the new pieces! Shout out to August Sandstr√∂m for his great work!
