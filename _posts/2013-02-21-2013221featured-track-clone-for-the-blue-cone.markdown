To celebrate the release of "Sounds from the Treetops" we're going to feature one track each week! It's free to play below and if you like it, it costs just $1 to download for keeps.

This weeks track is Maria Finkelmeier's beautiful composition "Clone, for the Blue Cone", Maria plays marimba on this track and Angela Shankar plays clarinet. The final part of this piece (around 6:00) really reminds me of our late night walks around Pite√• in summer.

Listen to this one with headphones, crank the volume, and check out Maria's awesome cadenza at 3:40!
