This week's featured track from "Sounds from the Treetops" is UFO: Crash Landing - Maria's thunderous and groovy opening for the suite. As you can see in the picture of the premiere performance, the setup for this piece is inspired by the UFO treehouse at Treehotel with all three players positioned around the central bass drum. Maria wrote three tightly interlocking parts for this work that blend together to form phrases that are far more complex and exciting than any of us could play by ourselves. I imagine that the three players in this piece are like the crew of the UFO, trying desperately to land with a damaged spaceship.

So click below to listen to UFO: Crash Landing, and press buy to download it for just $1, and man the impulse engines Commander, it's going to be a rough landing.
