This week's featured track is "The Cabin" composed by Jacob Remington. This treehouse is suspended out from a hillside with a long walkway leading to it and gave a spectacular view of the landscape around tree hotel. To Jake, The Cabin suggested a story of loneliness and isolation which he represents with this piece. 

In "The Cabin", our guest artists soprano Anna K. Larson and clarinetist Angela Shankar play intertwined melodic parts while Jake and I accompany with layered marimba and vibraphone parts. It was so much fun to play this piece that we couldn't resist doing some extra production on this track so Maria's percussion part became a thunderous multi-tracked percussion section!
