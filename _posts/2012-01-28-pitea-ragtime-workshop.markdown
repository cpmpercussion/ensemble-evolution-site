This January we've been running a ragtime workshop in Piteå with our visitor Christina Hopgood! Percussion students from both the LTU Institution for Music and Media and Framnäs folkhögskola are playing ragtime xylophone solos and in the marimba band for two concerts on February 2nd, Krokodil at 2pm and Framnäs Aula at 7pm.

Today Charles and Christina visited Framnäs to rehearse with the three students there in the Percussion House. After a great rehearsal they went for a walk since it was one of the first sunny days of the year and were treated to a magnificent Swedish winter view over the frozen bay.
