We've lived in Sweden for 2-3 years, and our Swedish is "bra" (good)...but if you drive just a few hours north and cross the border, we are once again dazed and confused foreigners in a land of multiple consonants and vowels, and entertaining inflection!

Over the weekend we visited our neighboring country for the first time (Finland! "Suomi" in Finnish) We drove 10 hours to teach and perform at the Palmgren Conservatory in Pori. We've been in touch with our good friend, Toni Hietala, since our festival (he drove his students all the way over here, so we wanted to return the favor!) We had a great time with Toni and his students, and are happy that we could arrange the collaboration!

Here are a few videos from the gig!
