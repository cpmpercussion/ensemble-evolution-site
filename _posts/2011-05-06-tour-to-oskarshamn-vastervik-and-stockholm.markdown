We have had a great time the past week teaching and playing in Southern Sweden. It took over 17 hours (over 2 days) to drive from Pite책 to Oskarshamn. Jake and Maria had never driven a stick shift before, but got the hang of it after a few 100 kilometers of dragging a huge trailer!

We spent 2 days in Oskarshamn teaching and coaching the students from the area. They were really responsive to everything we had to say and ended the sessions with a large group concert. Anders and Anna joined us as well, and it was a huge success. The newspapers even picked up on our visit: [Article in Oskarshamn newspaper](http://www.barometern.se/nyheter/oskarshamn/musikelever-fick-besok-av-trumproffs(2752085).gm)

Next, we drove an hour north to Anders' hometown of V채stervik. We performed withhis brother, Tomas', men's choir. They loved our version of Swedish folk tunes with Anna!

Yesterday was a free day which we spent in the most relaxing environment possible: on a boat in the Archipelago! It was great to spend time with Anders and Tomas, get some fresh air and have a true Swedish experience!

Now we are in Stockholm and will work with Rolf's students in the Army band tomorrow before heading back up to Pite책. It's been a successful week...full of great music and lots of bonding!
