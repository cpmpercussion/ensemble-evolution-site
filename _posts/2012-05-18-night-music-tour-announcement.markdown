We are pleased to announce our June tour, "NATTMUSIK, en ljud- och naturresa under midnattsolen" is confirmed!! (...for all of you English speakers out there, it's called "Night Music, a sound and nature journey under the midnight sun") Thanks to all of our sponsors for helping us make this happen! **Let's spread the word!!!**

Join Ensemble Evolution and friends as they unite the serene natural landscape of Northern Sweden with exciting and imaginative percussive and melodious sounds. Occurring at unique venues, the group will create new music inside and outside, surrounded by nature and under the Midnight Sun.

Musical collaborators include Anna Larson (soprano - see information under "biography" tab), Angela Occhionero (see biography below), Henrik Wiman (our fantastic intern, and percussionist studying at Framnas Folkhogskolan), and Mikko Savela.

**STORFORSEN **

On June 7, Ensemble Evolution presents their first concert of the NATTMUSIK tour. The event begins at 21:00 at Hotel Storforsen’s idyllic Chapel. The group will perform a variety of works for percussion, clarinet, and voice inviting the audience into an intimate and enchanted environment. Following the indoor concert, journey outdoors with the musicians as they perform a large work under the midnight sun, accompanied by the powerful sounds of the rapids and natural resonances of the land.
