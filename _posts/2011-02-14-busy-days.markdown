Our days are now consistently jam-packed with work, practice, and projects! We are working hard to prepare for some recordings on Thursday with Anders Åstrand and Evaristo Aguilar! We'll be laying down 3 pieces that we've each written for the trio, as well as some improvs (of course!) Festival preparation is also keeping us busy, we are so excited to have so many great participants registared! The schedule will be posted soon! We also have a performance with a great friend named Mirjana Petrova on March 2, playing spanish inspired tunes, as well as a concert with the chamber choir this Friday.

Individually we're all working on separate projects as well. Jake and Maria are doing some duo work, and just launched a Kickstarter Funding Project to commission 4 new works for percussion duo! Check it out here: [Kickstarter](http://kck.st/fGYnCK)!! Charles is working on a trendy interactive media project that involes iPhones and iPads. We'll all come together again at the beginning of May for a tour of southern Sweden to share everything we're doing up here. Exciting times!

The temperature today was -26°C...but we're not letting that get us down!
