The second week of our trip consisted of educational workshops and concerts at Canberra Grammar School and Australia National University. It was a rewarding week in regard to community outreach and exciting collaborations! We've never seen hundreds of young school boys so quiet and engaged, and working with the students and guest Thai ensemble at ANU was fantastic! Not to mention...we had two days at the beach to relax before heading back to the Northern Hemisphere!

Our concert at ANU was reviewed by [The Canberra Jazz Blog](http://canberrajazz.blogspot.se/2012/03/joy-of-buses.html)

When discussing our pieces, he writes:

> I could hear the representations in each tune. The Taxi was groove-based and rolling and lively with what sounded to be jazz-like improvisations over a repeating chord structure. The Lights were meditative, mystical, gently polyrhythmic and rich with tones like swelling cymbals and bowed metals. The band practices were endless and repeating, sometimes quiet and slow and searching, other times excited and confident. All spot on. The sounds were the thud of timber from the marimba, then ringing metal of the vibes, the crashes of cymbals and the drone of electronics. Attractive and so accessible that I wondered if it was radio-ready.
