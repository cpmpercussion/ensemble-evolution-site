We're super excited to announce that we're performing an ensemble showcase concert at PASIC 2013 in Indianapolis this November!

[![We're going to PASIC!](https://ensembleevolution.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/072df-pasic13top.jpg)](http://www.pas.org/PASIC.aspx)

We'll be performing our "Sounds from the Treetops" album along with clarinetist Angela Shankar and video from our premiere concert at the Treehotel in Northern Sweden. [Come join us at 12pm on Thursday, November 14](http://www.pas.org/PASIC/PASIC2013DailySchedule.aspx) to be transported to the eerie and breathtaking landscapes of summer nights in Norrland!

This is an amazing opportunity for us, and the great news is that along with our performance at PASIC we're planning a mini-tour in the Boston area and some really exciting collaborations! We can't wait to get the band back together and hope that you can join us in November!
