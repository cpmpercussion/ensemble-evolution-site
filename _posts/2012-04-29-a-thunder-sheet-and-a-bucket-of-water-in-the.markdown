Yesterday we premiered eight new pieces for percussion trio at the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre in Vilnius. As one of the two resident ensembles at a festival called _The Process, _young composers were able to try out some new ideas and sounds using us as their guinea pigs. It was quite fun to see what each composer came up with, and even more fun to try to figure out the concert logistically: none of the set-ups were the same, and with just three of us it was quite a feat to make the concert cohesive! It was great to experience a new city and meet some new people. Hard work becomes a little more tolerable when you are surrounded by energy, music...and free food :)
