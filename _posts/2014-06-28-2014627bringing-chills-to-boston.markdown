Last month, Charles and I embarked on a little side project. Charles was to attend CHI2014 (a conference focused on human-computer interaction) in Toronto, Canada to show his work with iPads. Since, in the grand scheme of things, Toronto is just a stone's throw from Boston, it was the perfect excuse to get together! Additionally, the post-conference dates lined up with the dates for [ArtWeek Boston](http://artweekboston.org/). Stars aligned - gigging time!

Trying to think of a unique venue to pursue, I was Inspired by the [new ice "concert hall" in Sweden](http://www.icemusic.se/). So, I contacted the Frost Ice Bar here in Boston. I asked them if we could do some concerts on ice instruments. They connected me to an ice artist and Frostbeat was born! We did six 20 minute performances - it was a bit chilly in there!

Next, I connected with the Scandinavian Cultural Center, and pitched to perform Charles' works "[nordlig vinter](http://charlesmartin.com.au/nordlig-vinter/)" based on those chilly winters in Pite√•! We projected photos and videos from our time in Sweden and performed Charles' music - that incorporated tons of improvisation and his iPad instruments! Here are a few videos form the event, shot by Scott Quade.

Lastly, we performed an experimental show at Outpost 186 in Cambridge to feature Charles' work with iPads. He wrote a great blog post about it [on his website. ](http://charlesmartin.com.au/blog/2014/5/22/nordlig-vinter-ipad-concerts-in-boston)

I love being able to curate new projects with such an awesome colleague! Who knew that our experience in Sweden would inspire so many cool performances and collaborations.
