We're excited to perform our Sounds from the Treetops suite at the Arnold Arboretum's Hunnewell Building tomorrow evening at 8pm! [More info and tickets available here](https://my.arboretum.harvard.edu/Info.aspx?DayPlanner=1250&DayPlannerDate=11/9/2013)!  
  
We had a great day there today setting up, rehearsing and performing at a special open rehearsal where we developed a new work "Sonic Scenes from the Arboretum" along with members of Boston Percussion Group. This new work consists of a collective improvisation inspired by Adam DeTour's amazing photos of the arboretum.

The musical and visual experience starts at 8pm tomorrow - book tickets to avoid disappointment! Only 75 seats available!
