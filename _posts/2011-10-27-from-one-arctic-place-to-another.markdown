![Next week, we'll be traveling about 30 hours to the other side of the world! The climate will be simlar, but the scenery, language, and culture will be much different.  We're excited to spend a week with Ensemble 64.8 and Morris Palter in Fairbanks, Alaska. They attended our festival last year, and the collaboration proved to be a huge success. We'll be performing a group concert on Saturday, November 5, and giving masterclasses throughout the week. Hopefully our Piteå weather training will be sufficient, we can brave (another) cold place! ](https://ensembleevolution.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/64329-img.png)
