# Ensemble Evolution

## An international ensemble exploring the future of percussion through composition, education and technology.

Taking elements of jazz and contemporary classical music, **Ensemble Evolution** creates musical experiments by incorporating improvisation, new media, and music technology into their original concept of a 21st century percussion ensemble.

Ensemble Evolution came together in September 2010 in Piteå, northern Sweden to explore new music, composition and improvisation. Their first project was a collaboration with their mentor, mallet specialist Anders Åstrand, as well as international artists Dave Samuels and Evaristo Aguilar.

In 2011 the group created and directed the inaugural Piteå Percussion Repertoire Festival, attracting students and professionals from around the world. The festival concert series featured the premieres of new works from each member of the ensemble. The group toured Sweden in May 2011 in collaboration with vocalist, Anna Larson and Anders Åstrand and in November 2011, Ensemble Evolution were guest artists at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, forming "The Arctic Connection" with Ensemble 64.8.

Ensemble Evolution toured to Australia in 2012 with their original Solstormen program, hosted a series of visiting artists in Piteå and was an ensemble in residence at the Nordplus IP Music Laboratory THE PROCESS in Vilnius, Lithuania. Their residency in Sweden culminated with their NattMusik Tour of Northern Sweden and their performance of six new works commissioned by the boutique Treehotel at Harads.

**Ensemble Evolution**'s first album, "Sounds from the Treetops" was released in February 2013. Following this release, the ensemble was invited to perform the set at the Percussive Arts Society International Convention in Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition to this appearance, the ensemble completed a three-day residency at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, exploring the connections between sound and nature.

# Education

Ensemble Evolution have presented workshops and seminars to percussion and music students around the world. We specialise in working with students on improvisation, composition and present seminars on commissioning projects, entrepreneurship and our unique compositions and performance projects. Our three members have a variety of areas of specialisation and can present individual seminars and workshops on their particular focus. Our workshops are often culminate in a performance where we present one of our concert programmes and then, alongside the students, perform works by one of our members or created by the group over the course of the workshop.

To discuss a workshop or concert with us get in touch via [contact@ensemble-evolution.com](mailto://contact@ensemble-evolution.com)

## Topics for workshops and seminars with Ensemble Evolution

### Creating an ensemble and entrepreneurship

The group will discuss the experiences and challenges of starting an ensemble, running events and creating projects. We'll talk about why we started our ensemble and how our goals and focuses changed as we worked together.

### Unique performance projects

We will present and perform elements from one or more of our unique performance projects. From shop-front performances, wild graphic scores to treehouse concerts our ensemble has collected a library of unique experiences to spur the imagination of students and demonstrate the cutting edge of contemporary classical music.

### Improvisation and Composition

We will present our process of improvisation and collaborative composition. When forming our group, our first priority was to create our own music and throughout our time in Piteå, we have each experimented with different ways to share our creative processes and use our group as a tool for composition and practice. We'll talk about this process and present some of the music we've created together. This topic could also be the basis for a practical activity with each member of the group working with a small group of students.

### Higher Education around the world

The members of our group have studied music all around the world, attending universities in the USA, UK, Australia and Sweden. We will talk about the different perspectives on music education, percussion performance and repertoire that we have found around the world as well as how (and why) we chose to study overseas.

## Performance programs

### Solstormen

A suite of mallet trios written during the freezing weather of February 2012. This suite draws elements from jazz, minimalism and contemporary classical music and recalls the aurora borealis and the eerie landscape of Northern Sweden as well as the excitement of ensemble performance and improvisation!

### Sounds from the Treetops

Six works commissioned by the boutique Treehotel in Harads, Northern Sweden, this suite represents the six architecturally adventurous and artistically awe-inspiring tree house and the dramatic environment of the midnight sun. The unique compositional style and diverse interests of each member can be heard from piece to piece, while the suite is unified by their shared passion for percussion, sound and musical exploration. Each work will be accompanied by video footage of each of the tree houses and surrounding landscape, to transport the audience from the concert hall to the Swedish outdoors.
