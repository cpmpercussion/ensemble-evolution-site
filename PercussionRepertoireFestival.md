# Piteå Percussion Repertoire Festival

> Ensemble Evolution’s Piteå Percussion Repertoire Festival was a breath of artistic fresh air.  Stimulating, fun, diverse, and completely engaging.  This was a wonderful experience for me, both as a presenter and attendant.  I can only hope they host this festival again. - Casey Cangelosi
