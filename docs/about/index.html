<blockquote>
  <p>An international ensemble exploring the future of percussion through composition, education and technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taking elements of jazz and contemporary classical music, <strong>Ensemble Evolution</strong> creates musical experiments by incorporating improvisation, new media, and music technology into their original concept of a 21st century percussion ensemble.</p>

<p>Ensemble Evolution came together in September 2010 in Piteå, northern Sweden to explore new music, composition and improvisation. Their first project was a collaboration with their mentor, mallet specialist Anders Åstrand, as well as international artists Dave Samuels and Evaristo Aguilar.</p>

<p>In 2011 the group created and directed the inaugural Piteå Percussion Repertoire Festival, attracting students and professionals from around the world. The festival concert series featured the premieres of new works from each member of the ensemble. The group toured Sweden in May 2011 in collaboration with vocalist, Anna Larson and Anders Åstrand and in November 2011, Ensemble Evolution were guest artists at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, forming “The Arctic Connection” with Ensemble 64.8.</p>

<p>Ensemble Evolution toured to Australia in 2012 with their original Solstormen program, hosted a series of visiting artists in Piteå and was an ensemble in residence at the Nordplus IP Music Laboratory THE PROCESS in Vilnius, Lithuania. Their residency in Sweden culminated with their NattMusik Tour of Northern Sweden and their performance of six new works commissioned by the boutique Treehotel at Harads.</p>

<p><strong>Ensemble Evolution</strong>’s first album, “Sounds from the Treetops” was released in February 2013. Following this release, the ensemble was invited to perform the set at the Percussive Arts Society International Convention in Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition to this appearance, the ensemble completed a three-day residency at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, exploring the connections between sound and nature.</p>
