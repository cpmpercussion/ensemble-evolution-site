<blockquote>
  <p>Ensemble Evolution’s Piteå Percussion Repertoire Festival was a breath of artistic fresh air.  Stimulating, fun, diverse, and completely engaging.  This was a wonderful experience for me, both as a presenter and attendant.  I can only hope they host this festival again. - Casey Cangelosi</p>
