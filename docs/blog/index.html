				Last month, Charles and I embarked on a little side project. Charles was to attend CHI2014 (a conference focused on human-computer interaction) in Toronto, Canada to show his work with iPads. Since, in the grand scheme of things, Toronto is just a stone’s throw from Boston, it was the perfect excuse to get together! Additionally, the post-conference dates lined up with the dates for <a href="http://artweekboston.org/">ArtWeek Boston</a>. Stars aligned - gigging time!

Trying to think of a unique venue to pursue, I was Inspired by the <a href="http://www.icemusic.se/">new ice “concert hall” in Sweden</a>. So, I contacted the Frost Ice Bar here in Boston. I asked them if we could do some concerts on ice instruments. They connected me to an ice artist and Frostbeat was born! We did six 20 minute performances - it was a bit chilly in there!

Next, I connected with the Scandinavian Cultural Center, and pitched to perform Charles’ works “<a href="http://charlesmartin.com.au/nordlig-vinter/">nordlig vinter</a>” based on those chilly winters in Piteå! We projected photos and videos from our time in Sweden and performed Charles’ music - that incorporated tons of improvisation and his iPad instruments! Here are a few videos form the event, shot by Scott Quade.

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wZIQVQ172jA?color=white&amp;theme=light"></iframe>

Lastly, we performed an experimental show at Outpost 186 in Cambridge to feature Charles’ work with iPads. He wrote a great blog post about it <a href="http://charlesmartin.com.au/blog/2014/5/22/nordlig-vinter-ipad-concerts-in-boston">on his website. </a>

I love being able to curate new projects with such an awesome colleague! Who knew that our experience in Sweden would inspire so many cool performances and collaborations.

				Creating a new piece for <a href="http://www.adamdetour.com/">Adam</a>’s photos was a rewarding way to conclude our “Sounds from the Treetops” concert at the<a href="http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/"> Arnold Arboretum</a>. Adam spent weeks collecting materials and creating beautiful images to inspire our work. It’s always fun to collaborate with a new artist, especially when we give all creative license to them. We weren’t sure what Adam would come up with, and the results were stunning!

It was equally exciting to workshop the piece before a live audience during our open rehearsal. A couple in the audience emailed us an amazing review just after the session, which gave us a lot of great energy for the performance!

<blockquote>
  “We were just blown away by this afternoon’s session. It was an honor and joy to be able to witness creativity in the making. Because of your generosity and warmth, we were able to see and hear your piece take shape. When we arrived at 3PM, we had no idea what to expect. We knew the Arboretum, we knew a bit about percussion instruments, and knew nothing about you three. An hour later, we were transformed. Your sense of what the Arboretum conveys brilliantly arose from your talent, your collaboration, your art. Being present for that journey is an experience we will not soon forget. We are still talking about it.” - Eleanor and Fred Sabini

We hope that the video will be just as enjoyable. Some favorite moments occur around minute mark 1:20, 4:50 and 7:15 (all the way to the end). Take a look!

We are happy to announce that we are official endorsers of Grover Pro Percussion! Maria was lucky enough to meet Neil as a young undergraduate at the Ohio State University, and has been using his tambourines, triangles, and snare drums ever since! (The triangle mount happens to be her favorite item and has been used religiously for years!) When she moved to Boston Neil was one of the first people on her list to contact, and he has been an amazing mentor and listening board ever since.

As the reunion tour was taking shape, it was obvious that we wanted to use Grover woodblocks for Charles’ composition, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKBu7aF8rDk">Planks, for the Tree Sauna.</a> Neil was kind enough to invite us to the factory, and we were able to pick the perfect trio! Not to mention, it was fantastic chatting with and learning from Neil over a yummy Brazilian lunch. After the visit, we were happy to sign the paperwork and officially endorse these great products!

At PASIC we had the pleasure of using many Grover products in our iPad/acoustic improvisation, The Birdsnest. The <a href="http://groverpro.com/grover-professional-musical-anvils-now-available">new musical anvils</a> provided a perfect pallet of sounds to explore! Thanks to Neil and the gang for making this tour and the convention so memorable! We look forward to more projects in the future!

<strong>After our residency, Pam Thompson (the manager of Adult Education at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, our main collaborator) sent this reflection to the community.</strong>

<blockquote>
  “Percussion trio Ensemble Evolution filled the lecture hall with exquisite sound.  In a workshop, the group sought audience input for a composition in response to their walks in the Arboretum landscape. Several attendees were regular Arboretum visitors and able judges of how well the musical elements supported their own experiences of the landscape.

  Taking elements from jazz and contemporary classical music, the ensemble performed Sounds from the Treetops on Saturday evening. The program ended with the debut of their Arboretum composition. Entirely mesmerizing with each piece uniquely transcendent, the performance surprised with its interplay of complexity, delicacy, and power.

  On Sunday, Ensemble Evolution with clarinetist Angela Shankar guided kids and their adult companions in creating percussive music from natural elements. Divided into three instrumental groups, we made music from bark, the leaves and stalks of bamboo, and an assortment of nuts and seeds. Angela encouraged experimentation with intensity and subtlety, frequency, as well as simple and layered sounds. We ended the morning with a raucous celebration of our newly discovered percussive talents.

  Each gave of themselves without restraint, revealing the passion that supports their profession. I am grateful to have witnessed such incredible talent.”

**BRIDGING SOUND AND NATURE, THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM WELCOMES ENSEMBLE EVOLUTION AS ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE, NOVEMBER 8, 9, and 10 **

The Arnold Arboretum opens its doors to international percussion group Ensemble Evolution, as its first ever Artists-in-Residence this November. A collaboration cultivated by percussionist Maria Finkelmeier, Ensemble Evolution will present a three-part residency highlighting the creative connection between composing and performing music dedicated to and inspired by nature. With a history of collecting inspiration from natural elements such as trees, unique landscapes, and extreme environments, the musician’s compositions are a combination of classical-contemporary and improvised works.

The series begins on Friday, November 8th, when the trio will work with local percussionists to produce a special composition for the Arnold Arboretum. Together, they will explore the landscape and examine photos of the Arboretum provided by photographer Adam Detour. Then, they will compose and prepare a new 10 to 15 minute piece that will paired with these images at the concert the following day. A workshop of the piece-in-progress will be open to public observation from 3 to 4pm.

The concert on Saturday, November 9th will take the audience beyond Boston and into the landscape of Northern Sweden—Ensemble Evolution’s home for two years. They will perform their self-composed album “Sounds from the Treetops,” a collection of six pieces inspired by the iconic Treehotel in Harads, Sweden. Tucked in the forest just below the Arctic circle, the Treehotel consists of awe-inspiring, family-sized tree houses that range in design from a spaceship to a floating cabin. Joined by New York-based clarinetist Angela Shankar, the music will feature a variety of instruments and timbres—from marimbas and vibraphones to drums and cymbals, from soft and delicate music to energetic and rhythmic. The performance will be accompanied by video projections from the Treehotel, collected by the ensemble at the premiere performance in June 2012, giving the audience a unique lens into this special place.

The residency will conclude with a family workshop on Sunday, November 10th, led by Angela Shankar and Maria Finkelmeier. Open to children ages five to eleven, the workshop will explore the sounds produced by plants and found objects in the Arboretum, such as seeds, branches and leaves. Attendees will have the opportunity to learn about making music, and explore timbres, volume, and rhythm. This fun workshop concludes with a walk in the landscape to practice the new sounds.

_Ensemble Evolution: Maria Finkelmeier (Boston, MA), Charles Martin (Canberra, Australia), Jacob Remington (Dallas, TX) with guest artist Angela Shankar, clarinet (New York, NY). _

  <strong>1 Session: Saturday, November 9, 8:00pm</strong>  <strong>Location: Hunnewell Building</strong>

  Ensemble Evolution presents a multi-media performance of original works inspired by the iconic Treehotel in Harads, Northern Sweden. The unique compositional style and diverse interests of each performer can be heard from piece to piece, while the set is unified by the group’s shared passion for percussion, sound and musical exploration. Each of the six pieces in Sounds from the Treetops relates to one of the tree house guest rooms and will be accompanied by video footage of these unusual abodes and the surrounding landscape, to transport the audience from the performance space to the Swedish outdoors. In addition, Ensemble Evolution will perform a new piece influenced by their experience in the Arboretum landscape. Note: This percussion performance will vary from soft and subtle to very loud. We will provide earplugs for those who wish to use them.

  <strong>Fee $20 member, $25 nonmember, $10 student</strong>

  Ensemble Evolution will be Artists-in-Residence at the Arnold Arboretum in November, performing and teaching composition and improvisation in response to nature.

This week’s featured track from “Sounds from the Treetops” is “Planks, for the Tree Sauna”, one of my compositions!

This track was inspired by the plank-like stairs that wind around the outside of the tree sauna, leading from the resting room underneath to the sauna on top. To represent this architectural feature, I have each of us playing a wood block while Angela’s clarinet provided a timbral counterweight.

The structure of the composition represents a walk through the forests of Lapland and the discovery of this incredible building. We slowly work our way through different combinations of pulsating rhythms, discovering different aspects of the natural environment. Each section of the piece is marked by the start of a different tone from the clarinet.

<img src="https://ensembleevolution.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/765d5-performingplanksatthetreesauna.jpg" alt="" />

For the recording session I was able to emphasise the environmental aspects of the piece with a collage of field recordings at the beginning and end. These recordings were made on the day that we premiered “Sounds from the Treetops” at Treehotel as I walked up the hill from the Pensionat to discover these incredible tree houses.

Planks is the last track from the album to be featured on our blog, so press play below to stream it for free, read through the text and if you like it, please consider buying the album for just $7!

This week’s featured track is “The Cabin” composed by Jacob Remington. This treehouse is suspended out from a hillside with a long walkway leading to it and gave a spectacular view of the landscape around tree hotel. To Jake, The Cabin suggested a story of loneliness and isolation which he represents with this piece.

In “The Cabin”, our guest artists soprano Anna K. Larson and clarinetist Angela Shankar play intertwined melodic parts while Jake and I accompany with layered marimba and vibraphone parts. It was so much fun to play this piece that we couldn’t resist doing some extra production on this track so Maria’s percussion part became a thunderous multi-tracked percussion section!

Check out the track for free and if you like it, show your support by buying it for just $1!
